# Polysome Overview

"Polysome" is a generative art project, simulating a microbial ecosystem using Processing.js and p5.js.

## Key Concepts

    Microbial Ecosystem: Mimicking behaviors like amoeba movement, mitosis, and parasitism.
    Textual Visuals: Representing elements of the simulation (e.g., organisms, cell walls) using textual glyphs like letters.

## Technical Approach

    Processing.js and p5.js: Utilizing these libraries for the simulation's graphics and dynamics.
    Git: Version control for project management.

## Initial Focus

    Entities: Two primary entities, nutrients and critters.
        Nutrients: Rendered as "o", moving on fixed trajectories.
        Critters: Rendered as "pq", chasing nutrients.
